# Zero to Spring Boot in Seven Days

This is the story of how I went from zero to Spring Boot in seven days, and how you can too. This entire article is based on my experience alone. Expect plenty
of Nodejs and Ruby references.

## Spring

The Spring Framework is Platform that provides you the building blocks to
a great Java app. This lets you focus on business logic without
being bogged down by the other stuff.

While the Java Platform is robust, as a developer your time is better spent
implementing your own application, as opposed to creating an ORM for your
database layer, or a web framework. This is where Spring makes things easier.

Spring provides a number of Java Objects which abstract away these low level
tasks

### Dependency Injection

### Modules

### Spring Boot

## Goal

For this project, we'll be creating a Spring app that lets us sign in, and get advice.

## Maven

Maven is a build automation tool for Java projects. It defines project details, manages dependencies, and can execute builds. Loosely translated, it's
like `package.json` and `grunt` for Java, all packaged into one, with Rails-like
conventions instead of configurations.

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that you:

  - Can Git it
  - Are comfortable with the command line
  - Have prior programming experience
